**CONNECT [UI]** is a component-based frontend web application framework based on direct DOM manipulation instead of change-detection mechanisms or rerendering the DOM (or the shadow-DOM). it aims to be a super-fast, lightweight modern framework for the front-end.

the core idea is to represent the async logic of the front-end on a graph-based representation, as it is an ideal representation for the flow of the program (that is no longer a sequential one due to its asynchronous nature). in that representation, state-binding and mapping data-flow become identical, hence removing the need for any implicit mechanism to link the two.
